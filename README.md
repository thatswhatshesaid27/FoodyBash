# Foodybash

**Foodybash** is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless and interactive food search experience. The application is built using a client-server architecture, where the server provides data and the client presents it in a user-friendly, dynamic interface.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: 
  - The server, built using **Express**, serves JSON data on `localhost:9000`.
  - The client fetches this data and displays it using a clean and interactive user interface.
  
- **Filtering Abilities**: 
  - The app allows users to filter food items based on different criteria for a more refined search experience.
  
- **Real-time UI Updates**: 
  - The UI is interactive and dynamically changes based on user actions, providing real-time feedback.
  
- **Hooks**: 
  - The client-side uses React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks to manage state and handle data.
